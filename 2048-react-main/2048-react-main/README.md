A modern implementation of the classic 2048 game built with React and TypeScript. Challenge yourself with this addictive puzzle game where you combine numbers to reach the elusive 2048 tile!

## Game Description

2048 is an engaging single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective is simple yet challenging: slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

### How to Play

1. Use arrow keys to slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right)
2. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum
3. After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in a random empty cell
4. Keep combining tiles to reach 2048!

### Game Features

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
